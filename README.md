# COS 426 Final Project

“Hello, World!” is a web-based, open-world game developed primarily in ThreeJS. The player inhabits the role of a nature photographer exploring a foggy forest, taking pictures of various wildlife over the course of several rounds. To earn points, the player must take a picture of each round’s assigned animal, keeping it as close to the center of the viewport as possible. Although the player is given a goal, there is no time limit, so they may freely explore the world around them, observe the animals, and listen to the peaceful background music. The creation of this game involved implementing such computer graphics concepts as the procedural generation of 3D objects (plants and animals in our case), mesh rendering, event handling, and user-controlled camera movement, as well as a scoring system based around measuring animal position in relation to the viewport center.
